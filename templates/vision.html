<h2>Our Vision</h2>

<p>
  Our vision is to create a future where technology enhances spirituality
  instead of disturbing it. Sugam Darshan aims to become a nationwide platform
  for intelligent temple management.
</p>

<p>
  We envision a system where devotees receive real-time updates about waiting time,
  entry slots, and safety conditions before reaching the temple premises.
</p>

<h3>Future Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Integration with smart city infrastructure</li>
  <li>Nationwide deployment across major temples</li>
  <li>Mobile application for pilgrims</li>
  <li>Multilingual support for global devotees</li>
</ul>

<p>
  By using AI and data-driven decision-making, we aim to make every pilgrimage
  peaceful, secure, and spiritually fulfilling.
