<h2>Our Motivation</h2>

<p>
  Every year, millions of devotees travel long distances to seek blessings at temples.
  Unfortunately, overcrowding, long queues, and lack of real-time information often turn
  a peaceful spiritual journey into a stressful experience.
</p>

<p>
  Our motivation behind <b>Sugam Darshan</b> is to blend faith with technology so that
  devotees can focus on devotion instead of discomfort. By predicting crowd levels,
  monitoring real-time movement, and guiding pilgrims intelligently, we aim to reduce
  waiting time and prevent stampede-like situations.
</p>

<h3>Problems We Address</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Long waiting hours during peak festivals</li>
  <li>Sudden overcrowding near sanctum areas</li>
  <li>Lack of proper communication with pilgrims</li>
  <li>Manual crowd handling by authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Our system helps temple authorities take proactive decisions instead of reacting
  after problems arise. This creates a safer and more organized darshan environment.
